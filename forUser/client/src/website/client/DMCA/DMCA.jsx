                        The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a U.S. copyright law designed to protect copyright holders and
                        prevent unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted materials on the internet. The DMCA provides a legal framework
                        for content owners to request the removal of infringing content and for online platforms to limit their liability for hosting such content.

                        If you believe that your content has been removed or disabled due to a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a counter-notice to request the restoration of your content. A counter-notice is a formal way of challenging the takedown and provides the opportunity to resolve the dispute.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                        To submit a valid counter-notice, you must provide the following information:

                    <ul className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                        <li>Your full name, address, and contact information (email and phone number).</li>
                        <li>The specific content that was removed or disabled and the location of the content before it was removed (for example, the URL or page address).</li>
                        <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed due to a mistake or misidentification.</li>
                        <li>Your consent to the jurisdiction of the court for the location where you are located, or if outside the U.S., the jurisdiction where your service provider is located, and your willingness to accept service of process from the party who submitted the original notification of infringement.</li>
                        <li>A signature (physical or electronic) from the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the content that was removed or disabled.</li>

                        Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, we will review the request and may restore the content within 10 to 14 business days, unless we receive further communication from the party who submitted the original infringement notice. Please note that submitting a counter-notice does not guarantee that the content will be restored or that the dispute will be resolved in your favor.

                    <ul className="text-gray-700 mt-2 list-disc pl-6">

                        We encourage users to respect the intellectual property rights of others and to use the platform responsibly. Repeated violations may lead to permanent banishment from the website and other legal actions that may be deemed necessary.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                        The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides significant rights and protections to content owners. As the rightful owner of a copyrighted work, you have the legal right to control how your work is used, distributed, and displayed online. If you believe your copyrighted material has been used on EarnWiz without your permission, you have the right to submit a DMCA takedown notice to have the infringing content removed from our platform.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                        By submitting a DMCA notice, you are asserting that the content in question is indeed copyrighted by you and that its use on our platform violates your rights. Once we receive your notice, we will act promptly in accordance with the DMCA to investigate and remove any infringing content.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                        It is important to note that the DMCA also allows for a counter-notice procedure. If a user believes that their content was removed mistakenly, they can submit a counter-notice to have the content reinstated. As the copyright holder, you also have the right to challenge any such counter-notices through legal channels.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                        If you are unsure whether your content is being used without permission, we recommend consulting with a legal professional to better understand your rights and the DMCA process.
